          # - name: Set WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE app setting (if not already set)
          #   run: |
          #     az webapp config appsettings set --name 'UserServicePresentation20250718014607' \

          #   # Replace <YourResourceGroup> with your actual resource group name.
          #   # This step only needs to run once or if you want to ensure it's always set.
